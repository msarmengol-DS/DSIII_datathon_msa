# DSIII_datathon_msa
This is the final project of the five months course 'Data Science workcamp' @Codespace.
It consists in publishing a trained time series predictive model with end-to-end real data.
The scope of the project is:

👉 Load into bbdd delivered input data from excel files.  
👉 From bbdd, extract dada for working with dataframes to analyze, clean and complete data.  
👉 Split data in train/validation/test.  
👉 Create an experimet in MLflow and launch runs to select the besto model.  
👉 Deploy the model's API (python / Docker).  
👉 Get predictions for the model.  
👉 Deliver to bbdd the real data and predictions for further data anaytics in Power BI.  

This all following the steps have leraned as best practises.
