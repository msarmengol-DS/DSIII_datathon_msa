# DSIII_datathon_msa

This is the final project of the five months course 'Data Science workcamp' @Codespace.
It consists in publishing a trained time series predictive model with end-to-end real data.  

_This all, following the steps we have learned as best practices._

## The scope of the project is:
ğŸ‘‰ Load into bbdd delivered input data from excel files.  
ğŸ‘‰ From bbdd, extract dada for working with dataframes.  
ğŸ‘‰ Analyze, clean and complete data, resample, get exogenous variables by API (meteostat).  
ğŸ‘‰ Preprocess and transform data to adapts a time series problem to supervised learning.  
ğŸ‘‰ Split data in train/validation/test (X & y).  
ğŸ‘‰ Create an experimet in MLflow and launch piped runs to select the besto model.  
ğŸ‘‰ Deploy the model's API (python / Docker).  
ğŸ‘‰ Get predictions for the model.  
ğŸ‘‰ Deliver to bbdd the real data and predictions for further data anaytics in Power BI.  

ğŸ¥‡ _The delivered prediction is_ ğŸ¥‡
